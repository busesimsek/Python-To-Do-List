## Functions

### Load Tasks

This function loads saved tasks from `gorevler.txt` into a list when the program starts. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new task list.

### Save Tasks

This function writes the current list of tasks to `gorevler.txt` so that they are saved for future sessions.

### List Tasks

This function prints all current tasks in a numbered list format.

### Add Task

This function allows the user to add a new task by typing it in. The new task is then added to the list and saved to the file.

### Edit Task

This function displays all current tasks and allows the user to update the text of a selected task by its number.

### Delete Task

This function displays all current tasks and allows the user to delete a selected task by its number.
